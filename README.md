# random-examples

This repo holds random chunks of code that can serve as examples of how I have done things.

## In no particular order:
1.  A JWT client package.
2.  A proof of concept Content Addressable file server.  Files are broken up into blocks, hashed, and stored using the hash as a name.
3.  A simple web spider using goroutines.
